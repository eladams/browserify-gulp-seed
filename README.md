# Famous Browserify-Gulp-seed
> A seed project to get started with Famo.us development environment using Browserify, Gulp and Connect server (Live-Reload).

###Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elad/famous-browserify-gulp-seed
cd famous-browserify-gulp-seed
```
Optionally reset git history:
```bash
# rm -rf .git && git init && git commit -m "initial commit"
```
then,
```
npm i # install dependencies
```

---

###Development
Run the dev server with ```gulp```

Now the dev server with Livereload should run on localhost:8080

Greatly influenced by [Famous/browserify-seed](https://github.com/Famous/browserify-seed/).

###Pitfalls
If the bundle fails you might need to run gulp again, a fix will be applied soon :)
