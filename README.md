# Famo.us Browserify-Gulp-seed
> A seed project to get started with [Famo.us](http://famo.us) development environment using [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and a [gulp-connect](https://github.com/avevlad/gulp-connect) server (with Live-Reload).

###Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elad/famous-browserify-gulp-seed
cd famous-browserify-gulp-seed
```
Optionally reset git history:
```bash
# rm -rf .git && git init && git commit -m "initial commit"
```
then,
```
npm i # install dependencies
```

---

###Development
Run the dev server with ```gulp```

Now the dev server with Livereload should run on localhost:8080

Greatly influenced by [Famous/browserify-seed](https://github.com/Famous/browserify-seed/).

###Pitfalls
If the bundle fails you might need to run gulp again, a fix will be applied soon :)
