# Browserify-gulp-seed
> A seed project to get started with Browserify, Gulp, Livereload and Famo.us


###Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elad/browserify-gulp-seed
cd browserify-gulp-seed
# rm -rf .git && git init && git commit -m "Make it so" # optionally reset git history
npm i # install dependencies
```

---

###Development
Run the dev server with ```gulp```

Now the dev server with Livereload should run on localhost:8080

Greatly influenced by [browserify-seed](https://github.com/Famous/browserify-seed/).

###Pitfalls
If the bundle fails you might need to run gulp again, a fix will be applied soon :)
